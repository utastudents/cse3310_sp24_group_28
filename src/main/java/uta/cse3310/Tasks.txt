TODO LIST:
--> populate scoreBoard with colors (based on index?);
--> possible implement char[][] array with w,r,g,b for coloring.
    when highlighting a single cell, this is done w/o modifying array.
    
    when user clicks the second letter, the game checks the word.
    if word is correct. the game updates the color array, and broadcasts.
    if word is incorrect, the game ignores, and broadcasts anyway.
